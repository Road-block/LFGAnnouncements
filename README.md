## LFG Announcements
 
### Overview
LFG Announcements is a addon to help group and display dungeon and raid chat messages without having to do the impossible task of reading through the global channels. It's build to use as little of your computer's resources as possible, allowing you to have it running all day long without it slowing down or even making the game unplayable after a while.
 
### Features
- Group instance requests per dungeon or raid
- Filter dungeons and raids to only display what you're interested in
- Filter on dungeon difficulty
- Low memory usage compared to many other similar addons
- Ability to choose when the addon should be active (world, raids, battlegrounds, etc) to reduce the use of your computer's resources
- Option to remove boost and selling requests
- Change the font size and style to better suit your need
- Multiple custom filters. Group all your GDKPs together.
- Get notifications without having the UI open through sound, toaster window, or chat messages

 
### How to use
Using the minimap button you have the option to either left- or right click it. Left-click will open up the main UI, while right-click will bring up the settings.
